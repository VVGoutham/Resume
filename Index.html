    <p>
        Exploration is more than just discovering it’s about expanding, exploring out to explore new possibilities, Each step providing us with a wider horizon. Every time updating & presenting myself newly with technology to enhance my skills and knowledge and I strongly believe in hands on learning by applying them to practical work. My principle is, every time we cant get the solution by thinking in the same perspective of mindset, its about Visualizing and thinking in different perspective with beyond the limits, makes me adaptive and presenting myself in a new way.
